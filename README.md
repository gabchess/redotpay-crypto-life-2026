# RedotPay “Crypto Life” — São Paulo Concept

“Crypto Life” is the energy you feel when the RedotPay card powers a day in São Paulo. This illustration mixes coin mascots, street food, nightlife lights, and the RDP card as the main character, so the merch feels loud, playful, and ready to wear at MERGE.
